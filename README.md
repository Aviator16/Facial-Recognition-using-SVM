# Facial-Recognition-using-SVM
Short project on using SVM for facial recognition

The dataset used in this project is **fetch_lfw_people** dataset from scikit learn. Faces with at least 60 samples are taken as our dataset.

The non-linear kernel used is **Radial Basis Function** or RBF.

For classification metrics we used a confusion matrix.
